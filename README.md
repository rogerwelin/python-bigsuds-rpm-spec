# python-bigsuds-rpm-spec

## What
A spec file how to build an rpm of F5:s bigsuds library that are used to communicate with F5 Networks iControl API

## Why
Pip includes bigsuds, but if you are behind a corporate firewall or prefer to roll your own rpm:s and/or keep track of your dependencies using this spec file is a good idea. Another reason is that if you are using the Ansible modules __bigip__ to provision F5, bigsuds are a requirement,

## Tested on
- CentOS 6
- RHEL 6

Should also work equally well on CentOS/RHEL 7 but it's not tested
